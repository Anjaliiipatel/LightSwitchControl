# LightSwitchControl
Controls any lights associated with buildings, includes brightness to show how bright you would like the light to be and frequency to how far of a distance the light should be.
As well in the controls there is a runtime box to see how long the light has been on for. There is also how many watts the light is, efficieny in how well the light is and lastly the temperature of the light. All is running once again under the runtime where that can be stopped with the flicker switch underneath the active or non active switch. 

***I have put the entire code in one file with the .js file, .html file and .css file all in there
